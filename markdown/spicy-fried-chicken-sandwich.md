steps:
  - Thoroughly salt the [chicken breast tenders]. 
  - Combine [sour cream], [egg], and [berbere] for the marinade. 
  - Coat the chicken in the marinade and place in fridge for at least one hour, preferably more. 
  - Combine [paprika], [cayenne], [salt], [garlic powder], [onion powder], [oregano], [basil], and [berbere] to form the spice mix. Save 2 tbsp and set aside for the glaze.
  - Combine [all-purpose flour] and [baking powder] for the breading. Stir the unsaved spice mix in. 
  - Combine [honey], [sriracha], and [salt] for the glaze.
  - Pour enough [olive oil] in a Dutch oven or pan until it is half as deep than the tenders are thick.   
  - Dredge the marinated tenders in the breading. Working 3–4 pieces at a time, cook on each side until golden brown. 
  - Line the cooked tenders on a wire rack so that the excess oil can drip. 
  - Stir 1/3 cup of the leftover cooking oil and the saved spice mix into the glaze. 
  - If needed, empty the pan and pour in a thin layer of new oil. Toast the bread. 
  - Assemble sandwiches with [bread], [lettuce], julienned [onion], [cheese], and fried chicken dipped in the glaze.
