This dough is enough for two little pizzas. It's really dry when you first mix it, but while it rests it moistens up. To shape the dough, cut it into fourths. Take each fourth and spread it very gently away from the center and towards the rim. It should be quite thin except at the rim. Keep the toppings light and sparing. I like a few spoons of tomato puree, mozzarella rounds, fresh basil, a drizzle of olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt.
