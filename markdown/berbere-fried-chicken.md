steps:
  - Thoroughly salt the [chicken breast tenders]. 
  - Combine [sour cream], [egg], and [berbere] for the marinade. 
  - Coat the chicken in the marinade and place in fridge for at least one hour, preferably more. 
  - Combine [paprika], [cayenne], [salt], [garlic powder], [onion powder], [oregano], [basil], and [berbere] to form the spice mix. Save 2 tbsp and set aside for the glaze.
  - Combine [all-purpose flour] and [baking powder] for the breading. Stir the unsaved spice mix in. 
  - Combine [honey], [sriracha], and [salt] for the glaze.
  - Pour enough [olive oil] in a Dutch oven or pan until it is half as deep than the tenders are thick.   
  - Dredge the marinated tenders in the breading. Working 3 or 4 pieces at a time, cook on each side until golden brown. 
  - Line the cooked tenders on a wire rack so that the excess oil can drip. 
  - Stir 1/3 cup of the leftover cooking oil and the saved spice mix into the glaze. 
  - Dip chicken into glaze and serve!

Want salt and pepper on the table? Nah, at Ethiopian restaurants you'll find berbere and mitmita. All that incedible peppery acidity is from a spice called berbere. I supply my berbere from the Brundo Spice Comany at Café Colucci. It goes on everything, and it shines with chicken. I like to serve berbere fried chicken with ciabatta, lettuce, and manchego as a saucy sandwich. It drips everywhere.
