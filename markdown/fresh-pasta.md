  - label: 
    items:
      - quantity: 2 cups 
        name: all-purpose flour
      - quantity: 3
        name: eggs
        note: large
      - quantity: 1 tbsp
        name: olive oil
      - quantity: 2 tsp
        name: salt
        note: kosher

steps:
  - Pour the [all-purpose flour] into a mixing bowl.
  - Press a measuring cup into the flour pile until a well forms. 
  - Crack the [eggs] into the well. Add [olive oil] and [salt] on top. 
  - With a fork, beat the contents of the well. Slowly mix in the surrounding flour until fully combined. 
  - Knead the dough for about 5 minutes or until smooth. 
  - Shape the dough into a round ball and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. 
  - Generously sprinkle flour over a cutting board. Unwrap the dough and cut it to the fourths. Roll each fourth out until it's thin, adding more flour as you go. When you think it's thin enough, roll it out even more. 
  - Cut into any shape you desire. For pappardelle, fold along the short edge of the dough and cut into half-inch strips.

I like to mix everything in a bowl instead of straight on a cutting board. I find that it makes kneading a lot easier (and it also makes your work station a little bit portable). Once you do move to the cutting board, be very liberal with your flour. Ever so slightly dampening the cutting board helps the flour stick a bit more uniformly. When enough raw dough is exposed, add more flour. Otherwise, you'll be stuck separating out strands when you should instead be slurping up a fresh bowl of pasta.
