All of the sweetness of these pancakes comes from the bananas, so you want them as ripe and brown as possible to maximimze natural sugar. If your batter iss liquid, add more flour. If you don't have enough bananas, reduce the flour accordingly. I like to top with peanut butter and sometimes a pinch of honey.
